# Heavy-Light-Cars-Classification

The goal of this project is to classify cars into two categories, light and heavy, in such a way that given an input (image), our trained model will classify cars based on size.

# Dataset

a total of 783 photos were used, of which 387 are light cars and 396 are heavy cars. The images are from different angles and distances with a very high variety and despite the obstacles around them, which brings the accuracy to 84.81%.

# Installation 

Google Colab has been used as a tool for running this project.
